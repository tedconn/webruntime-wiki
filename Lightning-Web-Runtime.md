Lightning Web Runtime is an LWC-first application framework designed for speed and customizability. LWR is built and maintained by Communities and the UI Platform. LWR is formerly known as Talon and Universal Container.

LWR at its simplest is an opinionated way to build a SPA (Single Page App) using LWC. Some benefits of LWR right out of the box are:

1. Ability to test your application locally with live data from Salesforce
2. Something
3. Something

## Lightning Web Runtime at Salesforce

LWR was first built as a Community runtime replacement for Aura. Communities are simply websites with Salesforce metadata on top. We wanted building a community to be as simple as building a website outside of Salesforce. Although there are some Community concepts present in an LWR app -- like [themes](link here) -- they only serve to give you the full power you need to build real-world web applications and are not necessarily community specific.

### Timeline

LWR is currently an official open source project. It is used by the Lightning Tooling team in their [LWC Local Development](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2019/10/announcing-lwc-local-development-beta.html) project (Beta).

Communities is releasing a new LWR app in the form of a new Build-Your-Own Community. This community is customer pilot in 222 and is expected to go GA in 226.

### Development Experience

We want building an LWR app to be just as fun and easy as building on other industry-standard frameworks like Ember or Next.js. Although *LWR was conceived with developer experience in mind*, we are still working through what we call the "programmatic experience". What this means for you as a Salesforce developer is that for now you will have to spend an extra 10 minutes of setup time vs having a full out-of-the-box app with one command. We promise that is coming though.
