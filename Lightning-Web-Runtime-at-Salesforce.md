# Lightning Web Runtime

Lightning Web Runtime is an LWC-first application framework designed for speed and customizability. LWR is built and maintained by Communities and the UI Platform. LWR is formerly known as Talon and Universal Container.

1. Ability to test your application locally with live data from Salesforce
2. Something
3. Something

Enough talk. Let's build your first app!
